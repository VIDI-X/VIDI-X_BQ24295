## Upgrades and Improvements

The VIDI X Team, with the assistance of advanced artificial intelligence techniques, has significantly enhanced this library by adding new functionalities, improving the existing code, and optimizing performance for a better user experience and greater efficiency. Our upgrades include the introduction of comprehensive getter methods for critical battery charging parameters, enhancing the library's capability for real-time monitoring and control. Notably, we've added functionalities to accurately read and interpret the charge voltage limit, battery low voltage threshold, boost voltage settings, battery temperature thresholds (BHOT), and the input current limit. These enhancements allow for precise control over the charging process, tailored adjustments based on battery conditions, and more informed decision-making in energy management systems. The newly integrated features, such as detailed string representations of these parameters, provide users with straightforward, human-readable insights into the battery's charging state and health. This extension of the library, achieved with the VIDI X Team's expertise and AI assistance, greatly broadens its application scope, making it an invaluable tool for developers working on sophisticated battery-powered projects.
